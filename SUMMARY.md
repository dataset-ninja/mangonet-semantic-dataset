**The MangoNet Semantic Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 49 images with 6799 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*mango*).

Images in the MangoNet dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test_data* (4 images) and *train_data* (45 images)The dataset was released in 2018 by the Indian Institute of Science and Birla Institute of Technology and Science, India.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
